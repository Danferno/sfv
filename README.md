# sfv
This program will periodically check your folders for changed files and save copies of those. This way, you can always go back to older versions or figure out what has changed between then and now. You can specify which folders to check and how often, the default is every 15 minutes. 

The advantage over Github is that you don't need to consciously commit. The versions are saved automatically. The advantage over manually copying files and renaming them is that sfv takes almost no effort. As a side benefit, you can freely delete code or text in the files you are working on - if you ever need those bits again, you just get it from one of the older versions.
